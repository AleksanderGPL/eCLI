### eCLI is a command line interface made for fun and learning purposes. It is written in Python and is very simple to use.

## Commands
### The following commands are available in eCLI:
- `pcinfo` - Shows information about your device
- `info` - Shows information about eCLI
- `help` - Shows a list of all commands
